**Industry :** Ed-tech

# Problem Statement :-

The current management of student details is being done by keeping a digital record in various places, such as excel sheets and Google drive. Thus college faces problems with interlinking and data repetition, delay in data availability, redundancy in data, and non-manipulation of data. Moreover, as the number of students keeps increasing, there will be a vast increase volume of data, which will cause many problems in maintaining, updating, and retrieving the selected information.

# Azure Services Used :-

**1)Core Azure Services:**
1.	Azure App Service: Deployed the front-end (html,css,js) for user interaction & backend (php) .
2.	Azure Database for MySQL servers: It is used for creating MySQL database to storing and managing students data.

**2)Azure AI Service :**
1.	Azure AI Bot Service(Language Service) : Azure AI Bot Service facilitates interactive communication with AI-powered bots, enabling users to engage in natural language conversations to address their queries and solve problems efficiently.

# Project Description :

The Internet has become a part of most people's day-to-day lives in the world. People perform various tasks on the Internet; one of them is storing their data in a database where they are interested. In these databases, they can post the queries and retrieve the required data. There is a need for Student Information System software to manage students' data that helps in providing the required data with time efficiency, make all these data accessible on the online interface

# Key Features :

•	Ability to recall previously learned material – Students/learners can watch video courses as many times as they need. If they forgot something during the course they can come back and watch that specific part anytime.

• To maintain all the essential data in one place.

• Provide a facility for the teachers to know a student's attendance status in the college.

• Provide automatic generation of IEN Number for the students after confirmation of admission.

• Retrieve selected information about the students in excel format.

• Automate generation of student fee receipt, mark sheet and college id card.

• Provide seamless access of required data to respective college role heads.

# Future Enhancements :

The future scope of student management systems is immense and holds enormous potential for revolutionising the educational landscape. As schools seize these advancements, the future scope of student management systems will continue to grow and play a crucial role in moulding the future of education.The future of Management software lies in leveraging contemporary technologies, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and automation. These technologies can streamline workflows, automate administrative tasks, and minimise manual effort.

# Final Project Statement :

Student Management System can be used by educational institutions to maintain their student records easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using the manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant, and collecting relevant information may be very time-consuming. All these problems are solved by this project.
